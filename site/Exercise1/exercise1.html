        <u><h1>Harry Potter</h1></u>
        <u><h2>By: J.K. Rowling</h2></u>
        <h3>Throughout the series, <u>Harry</u> is described as having his father's perpetually untidy black hair, his mother's bright <b><u><i><f style="color:red">green</f></i></u></b> eyes, and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. He is further described as "small and skinny for his age" with "a thin face" and "knobbly knees", and he wears round eyeglasses.</h3>
